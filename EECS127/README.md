# EECS127 Notes

My LaTeX notes for the Spring 2021 rendition of EECS 127 with Professor Laurent El Ghouai. https://tylerzhu.com/eecs127

Notes are taken live during class, so they may contain errors. Feel free to submit PRs or comment on the Dropbox link, I really appreciate being told about typos!
